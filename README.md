# Airline Reservation System

This project is a simple console-based airline reservation system developed during my undergraduate studies. It demonstrates the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) using Java.

## Features

- **Reservation Management**: Supports seat reservations for both business and economy classes.
- **Customizable Aircraft Sizes**: Allows defining the number of seats for different airlines.
- **Airlines Supported**:
  - Turkish Airlines (THY)
  - Pegasus Airlines
- **Error Handling**: Ensures seat selection and class selection are validated.

## Project Structure

- **UcakRezervasyonSistemi.java**: Abstract class providing the basic structure and common functionalities for the reservation system.
- **THYRezervasyonSistemi.java**: Implementation of the reservation system for Turkish Airlines.
- **PegasusRezervasyonSistemi.java**: Implementation of the reservation system for Pegasus Airlines.
- **TestTHY.java**: Entry point to test the Turkish Airlines reservation system.
- **TestPegasus.java**: Entry point to test the Pegasus Airlines reservation system.
